    >A statistical graph is a tool that helps you learn about the shape or distribution of a sample. The graph can be a more effective way of presenting data than a mass of numbers because we can see where data clusters and where there are only a few data values. Newspapers and the Internet use graphs to show trends and to enable readers to compare facts and figures quickly.</p

    >Statisticians often graph data first to get a picture of the data. Then, more formal tools may be applied.</p

    >Some of the types of graphs that are used to summarize and organize data are the dot plot, the bar chart, the histogram, the stem-and-leaf plot, the frequency polygon (a type of broken line graph), pie charts, and the boxplot. In this chapter, we will briefly look at stem-and-leaf plots, line graphs and bar graphs. Our emphasis will be on histograms and boxplots.</p
