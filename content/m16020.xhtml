      >descriptive statistics</strong

        class="emphasis"
      >inferential statistics</strong
    >. Statistical inference uses probability to determine how confident we can be that the conclusions are correct.</p

    >Effective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for producing data and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more confident in the decisions you make in life.</p
